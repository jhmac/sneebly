# Sneebly Heartbeat Configuration

## Budget
- Max API spend per heartbeat: $25.00 (stop processing if exceeded)
- Budget warning threshold: $20.00 (log a warning)

## Schedules
- Error triage: every heartbeat
- Performance check: every heartbeat
- Codebase discovery: every 3 heartbeats
- Approved queue: every heartbeat
- Codebase analysis: weekly, Mondays
- Self-improvement: weekly, Fridays

## Thresholds
- Performance degradation alert: >20% increase in p95 response time
- Error escalation: 3+ occurrences of same error
- Health check timeout: 10000 seconds

## Notes
The execution order (security check -> health -> errors -> performance -> discovery -> queue -> weekly tasks) is hardcoded in the orchestrator for safety. This file controls the configurable parameters that the orchestrator reads — not the order of execution. Discovery runs before the approved queue so newly generated specs get picked up in the same heartbeat.
